# Kubow

Kubow is service an architecture-based self-adaptation service for kubernetes applications. 

The main goal of Kubow is to provide an architecture-based self-adaptation solution for containerized Kubernetes applications. The proposed solution is a Docker and Kubernetes customization of the Rainbow architecture-based self-adaptation framework, originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Rainbow is a framework that separates out the concern of self-adaptation so that it can be engineered, analyzed, and changed more easily than dispersing the cabapilities throughout a system. Rainbow uses model-based self-adaptation, primarly focussing on software architecture models, to help diagnose and localize problems and select adaptations that based on how they fix or improve architectural issues.
