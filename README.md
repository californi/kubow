# Kubow

Kubow is service an architecture-based self-adaptation service for kubernetes applications. 

The main goal of Kubow is to provide an architecture-based self-adaptation solution for containerized Kubernetes applications. The proposed solution is a Docker and Kubernetes customization of the Rainbow architecture-based self-adaptation framework, originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University. 


The primary goals are:

* separates out the concern of self-adaptation from the system;
* uses software archiecture models as the basis for reasoning about the state of the system and applicable adaptations;
* uses utility-based decision making to determine the best adaptation among a set of potentially applicable adaptations;
