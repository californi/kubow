Kubow is an architecture-based self-adaptation service for Kubernetes applications. 

Kubow was implemented as a Docker and Kubernetes customization of the [Rainbow](https://github.com/cmu-able/rainbow) self-adaptive framework, originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University's [ABLE research group](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/). 

As with Rainbow, Kubow's primary features are:

* separates out the concern of self-adaptation from the managed system;
* uses software archiecture models as the basis for reasoning about the state of the system and applicable adaptations;
* uses utility-based decision making to determine the best adaptation among a set of potentially applicable adaptations;

To getting started with Kubow, see the documentation in the /samples folder in Kubow's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ppgia-unifor/kubow/).
