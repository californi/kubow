# Kubow Samples

This repository contains example projects to showcase Kubow and how to use the features provided.

We have separate folders for the samples of individual projects and versions. Each folder has the deployment files for project itself
and a folder for kubow customizations. There is a Kubow folder with Kubow`s default for all projects.

* `kube-znn-multi-nodes`:
